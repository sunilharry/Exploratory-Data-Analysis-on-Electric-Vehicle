 Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Electric-Vehicle

 Introduction : 

This project focuses on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of electric vehicle data, providing insights into the 
distribution and trends of EVs across various manufacturers, states, and years. The analysis is divided into three key tasks:

1.	Task 1: Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
We explore key variables like Electric Range, Base MSRP, and EV Manufacturer (Make). This involves plotting distributions (histogram),
relationships (scatter plots), and comparisons across categories (box plots) to understand EV characteristics.

2.	Task 2: Choropleth Map
A Choropleth map visualizes the geographic distribution of electric vehicles across the United States,
using vibrant colors to display the number of EVs per state, offering geographical insights into EV adoption.

3.	Task 3: Racing Bar Plot
A dynamic Racing Bar Plot shows the rise in popularity of different EV manufacturers over time. This animation illustrates how various manufacturers
have gained market share across the years.
